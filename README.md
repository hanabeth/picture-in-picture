# Picture in Picture

I created this project as a way to play around with the Screen Capture API.

## About

On the webpage you will be prompted to select a screen or tab that you would like to display. After selecting, press the "START" button. A pop-up of your chosen screen will show up and you can drag it and display it anywhere.
